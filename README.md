Abstract
========

Universal Device Metadata(UDM) Specification is a microformat intended to describe any kind of device and its characteristics.  
It isn't intended as a programatic interface description to low level hardware details (like addresses and registers), but as a 
high level reference to a device's overall hardware specs, like memory, CPU details, etc.
